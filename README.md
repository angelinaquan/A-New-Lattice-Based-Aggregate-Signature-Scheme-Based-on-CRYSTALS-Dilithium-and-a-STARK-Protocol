# A New Lattice-Based Aggregate Signature Scheme Based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium and a STARK Protocol
Implementation Code for the Research Project "Improving Bitcoin's Post-Quantum Transaction Efficiency with Novel Lattice-Based Aggregate Signature Scheme Based on CRYSTALS-Dilithium and a STARK Protocol" by Yunjia Quan

**WARNING**: Note that this is a research project. It has not been audited and may contain bugs or flaws. This implementation is NOT ready for production use.

## Content
This repository contains the following files: 
- [main.py](main.py) sets parameters and define necessary classes
- [main_algs.py](main_algs.py) contains the five-tuple of the main algorithms which makes up our proposed LAS scheme
- [ntt.py](ntt.py) implements NTT domain representation for all polynomials in modulo q
- [test.py](test.py) ensures that everything is implemented properly
- [supp_algs.py](supp_algs.py) includes supplemental/support algorithms that we use for other functions
